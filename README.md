# Interactive Graphics final project

This is the repository of the final project of the Interactive Graphics course.

The proposed word is a personal re-implementation of the famous racing game [Mario Kart](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart) produced by [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/). The adopted library is [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) (version 4.2).

Please, refer to the *Game Link* section below to play and interact with the game.

## How to play

### Commands

- **W**, **A**, **S** and **D** to move the car along the race truck;
- **E** to use the item collected if one of the item boxes is hitten;
- **R** to restart the race.

### Items effect

We provide four different items in the scene, each of them has a specific effect on the racers according to the *Mario Kart* game literature. The available items are:
- **banana**, if a car hits this object it will do a spin;

- **green shell**, if used it will follow a straight trajectory and may hit a car along its path;

- **red shell**, if used it will follow a target car in front of the user car and there is a high probability to hit it;

### Race Modalities

We provide two race modalities that the user can select:
- **Grand Prix**, a little tournament of three races where there is a cumulative score for each of them;
- **Single race**, if the user wants to run one race only, just select the single race truck in the main menu during the game.

### Character selection

The user is free to select one of the four players provided in the game. We offer the possibility to choose between some of the most loved *Mario Kart* icons:
- **Mario**;
